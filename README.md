# My Project Showcase


### <a href="https://github.com/karenrds/test-driven-development-roman-numerals">Roman Numerals Kata</a>

In this task, I had to develop a program to convert between normal numerals and
Roman numerals. I conducted research about roman numerals and how they
were calculated and how I could use this approach in my program.
I developed my program using Test-Driven Development (TDD) by writing the test
first and used the red, green, refactor approach. I used a parameterized test
where I passed a stream of arguments to pass multiple parameters to my test
cases
Writing test cases to fail and modifying step-by-step helps me avoid duplication.
Debugging helped me find errors in my code.
TDD helped me focus on the requirements (Given, When, Then).

### <a href="https://github.com/karenrds/mars-rover-kata1">Mars Rover Kata</a>

I developed a program to move rovers on the mars surface.
I made the assumption that the mars plateau is a rectangular grid.
The grid has two lines, an x-axis and a y-axis. I set the dimensions for the
surface of mars and then tried to move rovers by implementing methods to turn
left, right and move ahead with a string of commands. The result was the rover's
final position on the grid and the direction.
I used Object-Oriented Programming Principles and the Test-Driven
Development (TDD) approach for writing cleaner code without repetitions,
descriptive naming (classes, methods, variables) and improving my code
design. This task also helped me write test cases for different scenarios.

### <a href="https://github.com/karenrds/apilab1" target="_blank">API Interactive Lab 1 - Create a Web API to Serve back a JSON Response using a Test-Driven Approach</a>

In this lab, I was tasked with creating a simple Drinks Web API against the business requirements using a TestDriven approach. I utilised Spring Boot from the Spring ecosystem to create a Web API to serve back a JSON Response based on a Request.

In this lab, I ensured that my project
was well-structured and that all my
tests were passing.
What I found unique about this lab was
it got me to write my tests for the
controller first before writing the code. I
felt that by writing the tests first, I could
get a better handle on what the
business requirements are and be able
to double-check my test arrange, act
and assert structure. 

Topics covered and technologies used - 
* API Development
* API Testing
* Spring Boot
* Spring Web


### <a href="https://github.com/karenrds/book-manager-api" target="_blank">Minimalist Book Manager API - Add Delete feature</a>

In this lab, I was tasked with using a
test-first approach to work through a
Minimalist Book Manager API using
Spring Boot and develop a delete
feature against the user story. I
worked across all layers of the
application from the controller to the
service, model and repository with full
coverage of tests.

Topics covered and technologies used -
* API Testing
* Spring Boot
* Spring Web
* H2 Database
* Lombok
* Spring Data JPA
* Postman

### <a href="https://github.com/karenrds/book-manager-api-with-spring-profiles" target="_blank">Minimalist Book Manager API - API Documentation with Swagger</a>

In this lab, I used Swagger to create
auto-generated documentation for the
Minimalist Book Manager API. I
personalised the documentation by
configuring Swagger using Docket.

Topics covered and technologies used - 
* API Documentation
* Swagger tool
* OpenAPI 3.0 Specification
* Spring Fox and Spring Fox Swagger UI

### <a href="https://github.com/karenrds/book-manager-api-with-swagger-java-docker-aws-lab" target="_blank">Building and Deploying a Java application with Docker</a>

In this lab, I containerised a Spring
boot application using Docker. I then
deployed my containerised application
to Amazon Web Services Elastic
Beanstalk.

Topics covered and technologies used - 
* Spring Boot
* Docker
* Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic
* Beanstalk
* Spring Fox and Spring Fox Swagger UI
