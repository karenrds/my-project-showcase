# My Project Showcase


### <a href="https://github.com/karenrds/apilab1" target="_blank">API Interactive Lab 1 - Create a Web API to Serve back a JSON Response using a Test-Driven Approach</a>

In this lab, I was tasked with creating a simple Drinks Web API against the business requirements using a TestDriven approach. I utilised Spring Boot from the Spring ecosystem to create a Web API to serve back a JSON Response based on a Request.

In this lab, I ensured that my project
was well-structured and that all my
tests were passing.
What I found unique about this lab was
it got me to write my tests for the
controller first before writing the code. I
felt that by writing the tests first, I could
get a better handle on what the
business requirements are and be able
to double-check my test arrange, act
and assert structure. 

Topics covered and technologies used - 
* API Development
* API Testing
* Spring Boot
* Spring Web

In this lab, I was tasked with using a
test-first approach to work through a
Minimalist Book Manager API using
Spring Boot and develop a delete
feature against the user story. I
worked across all layers of the
application from the controller to the
service, model and repository with full
coverage of tests.

Topics covered and technologies used -
* API Testing
* Spring Boot
* Spring Web
* H2 Database
* Lombok
* Spring Data JPA
* Postman

### <a href="https://github.com/karenrds/book-manager-api-with-spring-profiles" target="_blank">Minimalist Book Manager API - API Documentation with Swagger</a>

In this lab, I used Swagger to create
auto-generated documentation for the
Minimalist Book Manager API. I
personalised the documentation by
configuring Swagger using Docket.

Topics covered and technologies used - 
* API Documentation
* Swagger tool
* OpenAPI 3.0 Specification
* Spring Fox and Spring Fox Swagger UI

### <a href="https://github.com/karenrds/book-manager-api-with-swagger-java-docker-aws-lab" target="_blank">Building and Deploying a Java application with Docker</a>

In this lab, I containerised a Spring
boot application using Docker. I then
deployed my containerised application
to Amazon Web Services Elastic
Beanstalk.

Topics covered and technologies used - 
* Spring Boot
* Docker
* Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic
* Beanstalk
* Spring Fox and Spring Fox Swagger UI
